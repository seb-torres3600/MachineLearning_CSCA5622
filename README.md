# Machine Learning : Supervised Learning

## Author: Sebastian Torres
This is a combination of my coursework for Machine Learning : Supervised Learning as part of my MSCS through the University of Colorado - Boulder

In this course, we learned various supervised ML algorithms and prediction tasks applied to different data. We learned when to use which model and why, and how to improve the model performances. We covered models such as linear and logistic regression, KNN, Decision trees and ensembling methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, kernel methods such as SVM.

We learned how to use data science libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, and sklearn. 

This course was taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulderâ€™s MS in Computer Science degrees offered on the Coursera platform.
